Problem :: Equilibrium Point
Given an array arr[] of non-negative numbers. The task is to find the first equilibrium point in the array.

The equilibrium point in an array is an index (0-based indexing) such that the sum of all elements before that index is the same as the sum of elements after it. Return -1 if no such point exists. 

Time Complexity :: O(N)
Sapce Complexity :: O(1)

Code :: 
class Solution {
 public:
    // Function to find equilibrium point in the array.
    int findEquilibrium(vector<int> &arr) {
         int total= accumulate(begin(arr) ,end(arr) , 0);
         int sum=0;
         for(int i=0 ; i < arr.size() ; i++){
             total -= arr[i];
             if(total == sum)return i;
             else sum+=arr[i];
             
         }
         return -1;
    }
};
