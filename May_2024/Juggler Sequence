Problem :: Juggler Sequence
Juggler Sequence is a series of integers in which the first term starts with a positive integer number a and the remaining terms
are generated from the immediate previous term using the below recurrence relation:


Time Complexity :: O(N)
space Complexity :: O(1) // Ignoring the space used for storing the vector which we have to return

Code ::
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> jugglerSequence(int n) {
        vector<int>v = {n};
        int num =n;
        while(num!=1){
            if(num%2){
                num =floor(sqrt( num*1LL*num*num));
                v.push_back(num);
            }
            else{
                num =floor(sqrt(num));
                v.push_back(num);
            }
        }
        return v;
    }
};
