Problem :: Mirror Tree
Given a binary tree, convert the binary tree to its Mirror tree.

Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.    

Time Complexity :: O(N)
Space Complexity :: O(1)

Code :: 
class Solution {
  public:
    void mirror(Node* node) {
        if(!node)return ;
        Node * l = node->left ;
        Node * r = node->right;
        node->left =  r;
        node->right = l;
        mirror(node->left);
        mirror(node->right);
    }
};
