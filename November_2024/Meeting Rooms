Problem :: Meeting Rooms
Given an array arr[][] such that arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, the task is to check if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.

Note: A person can attend a meeting if its starting time is greater than or equal to the previous meeting's ending time.

Time Complexity :: O(N)
Space Complexity :: O(1)

Code :: class Solution {
  public:
    bool canAttend(vector<vector<int>> &arr) {
            sort(begin(arr),end(arr),[](vector<int>&a , vector<int>&b){return a[0]<b[0];});
            int prev = arr[0][1];
            for(int i = 1; i<arr.size() ; i++){
                if(arr[i][0]<prev)return 0;
                prev = arr[i][1];
            }
            return 1;
    }
};
