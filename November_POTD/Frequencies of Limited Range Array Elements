Frequencies of Limited Range Array Elements

Given an array arr[] of N positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to P where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers from 1 to N. Make in-place changes in arr[], such that arr[i] = frequency(i). Assume 1-based indexing.
Note: The elements greater than N in the array can be ignored for counting and do modify the array in-place. Solution::
class Solution{
    public:
    //Function to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to N in the array.
    void frequencyCount(vector<int>& arr,int n, int p)
    { 
        vector<int>v(n);
        for(int &i:arr){
            if(i<=n){
                v[i-1]++;
            }
        }
        
        arr = v;
    }
};
